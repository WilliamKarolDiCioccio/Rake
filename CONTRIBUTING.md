# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to Rake! We appreciate your interest in helping us make Rake even better.

Before contributing, please take a moment to review the guidelines below. Familiarizing yourself with these guidelines will help streamline the contribution process and ensure that your contributions are consistent with the rest of the codebase.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that Rake adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Read the Conventions

Before starting, it's essential to read the [CONVENTIONS.md](./CONVENTIONS.md) file to get familiar with our coding style and naming conventions. This ensures your contributions align with the existing codebase.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you haven't already, fork the Rake repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

3. **Branching Strategy**: Create a new branch for your contribution. Please adhere to the following naming convention for your branch: `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/bug-name`.

4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes or additions to Rake. Make sure to follow the coding style and naming conventions outlined in [CONVENTIONS.md](./CONVENTIONS.md).

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Make clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose and content of your changes.

6. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to the branch on your forked repository.

7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository, navigate to the original Rake repository on GitHub. You should see a button to submit a pull request. Click on that button, fill out the necessary information, and submit your pull request.

8. **Review Process**: Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Please be patient during this process, as it may take some time.

9. **Merge**: If your pull request is approved and the maintainers deem it appropriate, your changes will be merged into the main Rake repository.

## Additional Notes

- Please avoid making large formatting changes or any changes that aren't directly related to your contribution.
- For major contributions or significant changes, it's best to discuss them with the maintainers first to ensure they align with the project's goals and direction.
