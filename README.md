## Welcome to Rake

Rake is a game engine project aimed at creating an easy-to-use game development tool for all levels of developers. It is designed to empower less experienced individuals in the game development world while teaching them how games work under the hood. Our mission is to make game development accessible to anyone interested, fostering learning and creativity.
